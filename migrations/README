Generic single-database configuration.

Used flask db init to set up migration repo which will track all of the changes made to the DB schema. There is a chance
you might need to change the schema in the future.

To set up automaatic migration use flask db migrate [-m "optional message"].

Once you run this cmd, you have generated a script which can either upgrade (to the new schema) or downgrade (to a previous schema)

But note that running flask db migrate will not modify the db schema.

To do this run flask db upgrade [to go to the new schema] or downgrade [to go to prev schema].

To access the DB in shell environment (and do testing) use flask shell in base directory.
